- The main difference here is that SREs revolves around the concept that operations is a software problem, which led them to define prescriptive ways for measuring availability, uptime, outages, toil, etc.

- SREs also ensure that everyone in the company agrees on how to measure reliability, and what to do when availability falls out of specification. This includes contributors at every level, from developers, through team managers and all the way up to VPs and executives.
